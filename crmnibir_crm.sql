Of course, Iâ€™m not a specialist in SEO but I have now a good understanding and I know where in Prestashop 1.6, I can make the modifications.\r\nNever less, the correction is not applied yet and your consulting advice could be still very useful.\r\n\r\nBasically I don''t have defined yet the SEO keywords for the www.pleasure-planet.eu website. As you can see, the website is targeting the male adult market. I''m not only targeting the gay market. The market area is Europe with a start with Belgium, Netherland, France Luxemburg and Germany. It will be difficult to optimize the site in 4 languages. Iâ€™m first targeting English and then French. German and Dutch will be in a second phase.\r\n\r\nAs you know, the Home page is the key page, but the brands, the product category and the products page needs to be reviewed too to appear in the first google ranking. The "Sex tips" section is genuine text and needs to be put forward. The section will be turned into a blog in some coming weeks - months.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately all text (home page, category product, product, sex tips) will have to be rewritten following the keywords definition.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see I have a lot of product. The wholesale provide weekly product updates in different format (CSV, Excel, Html) without automated links. The format of the data is different from each wholesale and the main data are the product title, the pics url, the supplier description and the price. Unfortunately, the supplier description is not genuine text and is not helpful in terms of SEO. The product specs (size, dimension, weight colours is often taken manually from the product title or the supplier description.\r\nIt would be very useful to have some advice about the choice of a web driven database to generate automated product short description, product name, image url , meta title, descriptions, and keywords (even if it is less important ).\r\n\r\nDo you have also an expertise in Prestashop?

I\r\nwould like them to take some initiative on functionality, and make\r\nsuggestions as to how things may work better, however, mostly I would\r\nhave decided this with the client already. I would ask for some input\r\nbefore sending the final static designs to the client for signoff\r\n(before the build starts). I would expect you tho source plugins to\r\nensure the site is easily managed from the clients end - i.e. the\r\nability to add content blocks/options on those blocks etc.\r\n\r\nI am a stickler for quality and expect a high level of service,\r\ncommunication and products. \r\n\r\nAll sites are to built under glue creative hosting, with a test site\r\nbeing transferred to live hosting once client has approved it. \r\nAll sites remain confidential and should not be used for self promotion.\r\n\r\nI prefer to set a budget for the entire build prior to starting which\r\nincludes ALL aspects of the build from test site, to launch.\r\n\r\nI normally allow a 3 week window for site build but would appreciate a\r\nshorter timeframe if you are able to.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this is enough info for which to provide a rough price\r\nguide - I look forward to hearing from you.\r\n', '', '', NULL, NULL, 'Send personalized email with prices in NZ$.
